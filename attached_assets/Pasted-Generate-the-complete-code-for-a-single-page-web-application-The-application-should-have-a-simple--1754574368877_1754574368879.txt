Generate the complete code for a single-page web application. The application should have a simple, minimalistic user interface consisting of a file input for uploading a resume (PDF or DOCX), a button to start the analysis, and a section to display results.

The front-end must be built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. No server-side code is needed. The entire process should be client-side.

The application's logic should perform the following steps:
1.  **Resume Upload and Parsing:**
    * Accept only one file at a time, either a PDF or a DOCX file, with a maximum size of 5MB.
    * Upon file selection and button click, the script should read the file's content into memory.
    * Use a client-side library to parse the file: `pdf.js` for PDFs and `mammoth.js` for DOCX.
    * Store the extracted text in a JavaScript variable. The file data should not be uploaded to any server.

2.  **Skill Extraction with Google Gemini API:**
    * Use the extracted resume text to make a POST request to the Google Gemini API.
    * The prompt for the API should be something like: "Analyze the following resume text and list all the technical skills found. Format the response as a comma-separated list. [resume text]".
    * Assume the Gemini API key is securely handled (for example, stored in a separate configuration file not included in this prompt).

3.  **Job Search with JSearch API:**
    * Take the list of technical skills from the Gemini API response.
    * Make a GET request to the JSearch API (RapidAPI).
    * The API query should use the extracted skills as search terms.
    * Set the search parameters to allow for a partial match, specifically a 60% skill match or higher.
    * Assume the JSearch API key is also available.

4.  **User Interface (UI) Updates:**
    * Display a "Loading..." message in the results section while the API calls are being made.
    * Once the JSearch results are received, clear the loading message.
    * Display the job results clearly, with each job showing:
        * Job Title
        * Company Name
        * Location
        * A short, concise description
        * A link to the full job posting
